The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

Source of data that used: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Variables/Tables:

- x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test are the tables included in the above source data link 
- trainingdata is the bind of the following tables y_train ,x_train, subject_train
- testdata is the bind of the following tables y_test, x_test, subject_test
- dataset is the bind of the following tables trainingdata,testdata 
- features includes features.txt file from above source link which is the list of all features 
- mean_and_Std_features search for matches to argument pattern (mean|std) within each element of a vector
- activities includes activity_labels.txt file from above source link which links the class labels with their activity name 
- xdata is the bind of x_train and x_test which contain numeric variables. Apply mean_and_Std_features to xdata to extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- ydata is the bind of y_train and y_test which contain activity related variables. Apply activities to name the activities in the dataset 
- subjectdata is the bind of subject_test and subject_train. Appropriately label the subjectdata with correct activity names
- updated_dataset is the bind of the following tables xdata,ydata, subjectdata
- updated_Dataset_Averages is a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 

Output:
- updated_Dataset_Averages has 180 observations of 68 variables
- The 1st column contains subject codes 
- The 2nd column contains activity names 
- The averages of each variable for each activity and each subject is in the following 66 attributes which are in columns 3-68.
